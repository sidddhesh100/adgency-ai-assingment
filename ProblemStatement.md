## Project Description: Book Review Platform API with Authentication and RBAC

**Objective:**
Develop a RESTful API for a Book Review Platform using Flask. The platform should allow users to post book reviews, rate books, and comment on reviews. It will include user authentication, role-based access control, and advanced functionalities like search and filtering.

**Requirements:**

### User Authentication and Authorization:

- Implement user registration and login.
- Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication.
- Implement RBAC with at least two roles: Regular User and Administrator.
- Administrators can manage user accounts and moderate reviews and comments.

### Book and Review Management:

- Users can add books to the platform (title, author, genre, publication year).
- Users can post reviews on books (rating, text).
- Users can comment on reviews.
- Implement functionality for users to edit and delete their own reviews and comments.

### Advanced Features:

- Implement a search functionality to find books by title, author, or genre.
- Add a feature to filter books by rating, genre, or publication year.
- Implement a rating system where users can rate books (1-5 stars).

### Data Persistence:

- Use an SQL or NoSQL database to persist data.
- Ensure proper database schema design for efficient data retrieval and storage.

### Security and Best Practices:

- Ensure the secure storage of user passwords (consider using bcrypt).
- Implement proper error handling and validation for user inputs.
- Ensure the API responses do not expose sensitive user data.

### Documentation and Testing:

- Provide a comprehensive README with setup instructions and API documentation.
